> **Time:** 15 minutes
> **Goal:** Identify any task type instantly by looking at its markers and ticket.

---

## Instructions

### Part A: Study the Reference (5 min)
Read `REFERENCE.md` — it explains all 4 task types and their marker patterns.

### Part B: Classify Tasks (10 min)
Run `task_classifier.py` and classify each task scenario by its type.

`ash
python task_classifier.py
`

The script presents 6 scenarios. For each one, identify:
1. The task type (Bug Fix / Feature Ship / Maintenance / Debugging)
2. What markers (if any) you'd expect to find

### Self-Check
Score 5/6 or above means you're ready for Week 1.
