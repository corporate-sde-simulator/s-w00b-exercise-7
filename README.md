## How Each Exercise Works

Each exercise folder contains:
- `INSTRUCTIONS.md` — What to do (step-by-step)
- `REFERENCE.md` — The full guide/reference material
- Activity files — Hands-on tasks (quizzes, sample projects, classifiers)

## Suggested Order
Go in order (1 → 7). Each exercise builds on the previous one.

## After Completing Week 0B
